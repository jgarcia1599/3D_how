# 3D_how
A project sponsored by the Dhakira Centre of Heritage Studies at NYUAD.


# Comands 
Install Node dependencies:
if you haven't already installed Node.js, visit the site below and lay it down
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

next, open terminal or cmd and install the http-server module globally on your machine
sudo npm install http-server -g

To run server:

Go to repo: 
cd 3D_how

run simple http-server:
http-server -p [Desired port]

Running a simple server is necessary as some of the models are only displayed in the website if its hosted on a simple local server.

# To do List:

- Learn how to use Agisoft Metashape and Blender for photogrammetry and 3D model editing.
- Learn how to create a backend (probably using Node.js)to deal with the "database aspect" of the project.
-Learn how to incorporate user interaction to a Babylon project.
- Continue Babylon.js self-learning and apply changes to project as learning progress continues.
