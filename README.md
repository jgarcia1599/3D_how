A project sponsored by the <a href="https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/research/centers-labs-and-projects/dhakira-center-for-heritage-studies-in-the-uae.html"> Dhakira Centre of Heritage Studies</a> at NYUAD.


# Comands 
Install Node dependencies:
if you haven't already installed Node.js, visit the site below and lay it down
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

next, open terminal or cmd and install the http-server module globally on your machine:   
sudo npm install http-server -g

To run server:

Go to repo:    
cd 3D_how

run simple http-server:   
python3 -m http.server [port#]

Running a simple server is necessary as some of the models are only displayed in the website if its hosted on a simple local server.

# To do List:

- Learn how to use Agisoft Metashape and Blender for photogrammetry and 3D model editing.
- Learn how to create a backend (probably using Node.js)to deal with the "database aspect" of the project.
-Learn how to incorporate user interaction to a Babylon project.
- Continue Babylon.js self-learning and apply changes to project as learning progress continues. 

# Team Meetings:

## March 18, 2020
Robert's Comments:     
- Receive information to add to the website via Google Drive.
- We will have several different models, each with its own "playground" mode to interact with.
- Start working on adding different layers of interaction. Click on hotspots to get information and see videos about the boat. 
- For Later: historical pictures processed in a 3d way, depth of the picture, timeline scroll bar to change background over time.
